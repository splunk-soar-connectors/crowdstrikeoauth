## Multitenancy

This connector supports CrowdStrike multitenancy for the following actions:

- 'query device'
- 'quarantine device'
- 'unquarantine device'
- 'hunt file'

If you have multiple tenants, add the subtenant IDs you want to automatically use in the above actions to the 'subtenants' parameter in the asset configuration. Once added, these subtenants will be used by default in those actions. However, if after you want to target a specific tenant instead, you can override the default behavior by specifying the desired tenant’s ID in the 'cid' parameter within the action.

## Preprocess Script

The user can add a script file in the configuration parameter \[ **Script with functions to
preprocess containers and artifacts** \]. The script must contain a function with the name
**preprocess_container** (to pre-process the containers and the artifacts) or else, it will throw an
error.

## App ID

- Optionally, you can specify an **App ID** to be used with the Crowdstrike OAuth API used in the
  on poll action. If one isn't set, it will default to the asset ID.
- It is recommended to have a unique **App ID** for each connection to the Crowdstrike OAuth API.
  That is to say, if you are planning on having multiple assets using the Crowdstrike OAuth API at
  once, you should give them unique App IDs.

## On Poll

- Common points for both manual and scheduled interval polling
  - Default parameters of the On Poll action are ignored in the app. i.e. start_time, end_time,
    container_count, artifact_count
  - The app will fetch all the events based on the value specified in the configuration
    parameters [Maximum events to get while POLL NOW] (default 2000 if not specified) and
    [Maximum events to get while scheduled and interval polling] (default 10,000 if not
    specified). For ingestion, the events are fetched after filtering them based on the event
    types - **DetectionSummaryEvent** and **EppDetectionSummaryEvent**. The app will exit from the polling cycle in the
    below-mentioned 2 cases whichever is earlier.
    - If the total events fetched equals the value provided in the \[Maximum
      events to get while POLL NOW\] (for manual polling) or \[Maximum events to get while
      scheduled and interval polling\] (for scheduled | interval polling) parameters
    - If the total number of continuous blank lines encountered while streaming the data
      equals the value provided in the [Maximum allowed continuous blank lines] (default 50
      if not specified) asset configuration parameter
  - The default behavior of the app is that each event will be placed in its container. By
    checking the configuration parameter [Merge containers for Hostname and Eventname] as well
    as specifying an interval in the configuration parameter \[Merge same containers within
    specified seconds\], all events which are of the same type and on the same host will be put
    into one container, as long as the time between those two events is less than the interval.
  - The [Maximum allowed continuous blank lines] asset configuration parameter will be used to
    indicate the allowed number of continuous blank lines while fetching events. For example, if some events exist after 100 continuous blank lines and you've
    set the [Maximum allowed continues blank lines] parameter value to 500, it will keep on
    ingesting all events until the code gets 500 continuous blank lines
    and hence, it will be able to cover the events successfully even after the
    100 blank lines. If you set it to 50, it will break after the 50th blank line is
    encountered. Hence, it won't be able to ingest the events which exist after the 100
    continuous blank lines because the code considers that after the configured value in the
    [Maximum allowed continuous blank lines] configuration parameter (here 50), there is no
    data available.
- Manual Polling
  - During manual poll now, the app starts from the first event that it can query up to the
    value configured in the configuration parameter [Maximum events to get while POLL NOW] and
    creates artifacts for all the fetched DetectionSummaryEvents. The last queried event's
    offset ID will not be remembered in Manual POLL NOW and it fetches everything every time
    from the beginning.
- Scheduled | Interval Polling
  - During scheduled | interval polling, the app starts from the first event that it can query
    up to the value configured in the configuration parameter \[Maximum events to get while
    scheduled and interval polling\] and creates artifacts for all the fetched
    DetectionSummaryEvents. Then, it remembers the last event's offset ID and stores it in the
    state file against the key [last_offset_id]. In the next scheduled poll run, it will start
    from the stored offset ID in the state file and will fetch the maximum events as configured
    in the [Maximum events to get while scheduled and interval polling] parameter.

The **DetectionSummaryEvent** is parsed to extract the following values into an Artifact.

| **Artifact Field** | **Event Field** |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| cef.sourceUserName | UserName |
| cef.fileName | FileName |
| cef.filePath | FilePath |
| cef.sourceHostName | ComputerName |
| cef.sourceNtDomain | MachineDomain |
| cef.hash | MD5String |
| cef.hash | SHA1String |
| cef.hash | SHA256STring |
| cef.cs1 | cmdLine |

The **EppDetectionSummaryEvent** is parsed to extract the following values into an Artifact.

| **Artifact Field** | **Event Field** |
|--------------------|------------------|
| cef.sourceUserName | UserName |
| cef.fileName | FileName |
| cef.filePath | FilePath |
| cef.sourceHostName | Hostname |
| cef.sourceNtDomain | LogonDomain |
| cef.hash | MD5String |
| cef.hash | SHA1String |
| cef.hash | SHA256String |
| cef.cs1 | cmdLine |

The app also parses the following **sub-events** into their own artifacts.

- Documents Accessed
- Executables Written
- Network Access
- Scan Result
- Quarantine Files
- DNS Requests

Each of the sub-events has a CEF key called **parentSdi** which stands for Parent Source Data
Identifier. This is the value of the SDI of the main event that the sub-events were generated from.

## Falcon X Sandbox Actions

**This is different from Falcon Sandbox.**

- **Action -** File Reputation, Url reputation

<!-- -->

- Report of the resource will be fetched if it has been detonated previously on the CrowdStrike
  Server otherwise no data found message will be displayed to the user.

<!-- -->

- **Action -** Download Report

<!-- -->

- This action will download the resource report based on the provided artifact ID. Currently, we
  support the following Strict IOC CSV, Strict IOC JSON, Strict IOC STIX2.1, Strict IOC MAEC5.0,
  Broad IOC CSV, Broad IOC JSON, Broad IOC STIX2.1, Broad IOC MAEC5.0, Memory Strings, Icon,
  Screenshot artifact IDs.

<!-- -->

- **Action -** Detonate File

<!-- -->

- This action will upload the given file to the CrowdStrike sandbox and will submit it for
  analysis with the entered environment details. If the report of the given file is already
  present with the same environment, it will fetch the result and the file won't be submitted
  again.
- If the analysis is in progress and reaches the time entered in the detonate_timeout parameter,
  then this action will return the resource_id of the submitted file using which the submission
  status can be checked.
- If the submitted file will be analyzed within the entered time in the detonate_timeout
  parameter, its report will be fetched. Currently, these file types are supported .exe, .scr,
  .pif, .dll, .com, .cpl, etc., .doc, .docx, .ppt, .pps, .pptx, .ppsx, .xls, .xlsx, .rtf, .pub,
  .pdf, Executable JAR, .sct, .lnk, .chm, .hta, .wsf, .js, .vbs, .vbe, .swf, pl, .ps1, .psd1,
  .psm1, .svg, .py, Linux ELF executables, .eml, .msg.

<!-- -->

- **Action -** Detonate Url

<!-- -->

- This action will submit the given URL for analysis with the entered environment details. If the
  report of the given URL is already present with the same environment, it will fetch the result
  and the url won't be submitted again.
- If the analysis is in progress and it reaches the time entered in the detonate_timeout
  parameter, then this action will return the resource_id of the submitted URL using which the
  status of the submission can be checked. If the analysis status is running then do not re-run
  the detonate URL action, otherwise, the URL will be again submitted for the analysis.
- If the submitted URL will be analyzed within the entered time in the detonate_timeout parameter,
  its report will be fetched. Currently, 3 domains of URL are supported http, https, and ftp.

<!-- -->

- **Action -** Check Status

<!-- -->

- This action will return the status of the given resource_id in case of timeout in detonate file
  and detonate URL actions.

## Notes

- **Action -** List Alerts

<!-- -->

- The filter parameter values follow the [FQL
  Syntax](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/support/documentation/45/falcon-query-language-fql-reference)
  .

- The sort parameter value has to be provided in the format property_name.asc for ascending and
  property_name.desc for descending order.

- The `include_hidden` parameter has been added to the action as it's behavior in the API has changed. In the
  prior API version, the default behavior of the `include_hidden` parameter was either not supported or defaulted
  to `false`. The latest version of the API now defaults `include_hidden` to `true` if it is not included in
  the API call. Therefore, we have included this parameter in the action configuration and set it to `false` by
  default in order to keep the action behavior consistent with the previous app version. Hidden alerts can be
  identified by the `show_in_ui` field of an alert object.

  If you experience any `list alerts` action failures in an existing playbook that passed in the previous version
  of the app, you may need to edit the action in the playbook and then save. This will then add the `include_hidden`
  field to the playbook action.

- **Action -** List Groups

<!-- -->

- The filter parameter values follow the [FQL
  Syntax](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/support/documentation/45/falcon-query-language-fql-reference)
  .

- The sort parameter value has to be provided in the format property_name.asc for ascending and
  property_name.desc for descending order.

- **Action -** Query Device

<!-- -->

- Both the filter and sort parameters follow the same concepts as mentioned above for the list
  groups action.

- **Action -** Assign Hosts, Remove Hosts, Quarantine Device, and Unquarantine Device

<!-- -->

- The devices will be fetched based on the values provided in both the device_id and hostname
  parameters.
- If an incorrect value is provided in both the device_id and hostname parameters each, then, the
  action will fail with an appropriate error message.

<!-- -->

- **Action -** List Session Files, Get Session File

<!-- -->

- To add [session id] to the action parameters of these actions, a session with the Create
  Session action needs to be created. Also, the user can delete the session using the Delete
  Session action.

  - cat
  - cd
  - env
  - eventlog
  - filehash
  - getsid
  - ipconfig
  - ls
  - mount
  - netstat
  - ps
  - reg query
- To add [session id] to the action parameters of these actions, a session with the Create
  Session action needs to be created. Also, the user can delete the session using the Delete
  Session action.
- Example action run: If "cd C:\\some_directory" command needs to be run using this action, valid
  [device_id] and [session_id] parameters should be provided by the user. The user should
  select "cd" from the [command] dropdown parameter and provide "C:\\some_directory" input in
  the [data] parameter.

- To add [session id] to the action parameters of these actions, a session with the Create
  Session action needs to be created. Also, the user can delete the session using the Delete
  Session action.
- Example action run: If "cd C:\\some_directory" command needs to be run using this action, valid
  [device_id] and [session_id] parameters should be provided by the user. The user should
  select "cd" from the [command] dropdown parameter and provide "C:\\some_directory" input in
  the [data] parameter.

## Port Information

default ports used by Splunk SOAR.

| Service Name | Transport Protocol | Port |
|--------------|--------------------|------|
| http | tcp | 80 |
| https | tcp | 443 |

## Playbook Backward Compatibility

- The output data-paths have been updated in the below-existing action. Hence, it is requested to
  update existing playbooks created in the earlier versions of the app by re-inserting |
  modifying | deleting the corresponding action blocks.

  - list users - Below output data-paths have been updated.

    - Updated name from 'customer' to 'cid'
    - Updated name from 'firstName' to 'first_name'
    - Updated name from 'lastName' to 'last_name'
